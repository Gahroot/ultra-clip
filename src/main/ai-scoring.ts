    : ''

  return `You are an expert at analyzing video transcripts to find the most valuable, complete segments for short-form vertical video content (TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts).
${audienceBlock}

CORE PHILOSOPHY:
- Each clip will be posted INDEPENDENTLY to TikTok, Reels, and Shorts. The viewer has ZERO context — they have never seen the full video, they don't know the speaker, they don't know the topic. Every clip must make COMPLETE sense to a total stranger scrolling their feed.
- Quality over quantity. Fewer, better clips that deliver COMPLETE THOUGHTS and ACTIONABLE VALUE.
- Every clip must reframe thinking, teach something, or deliver an insight the audience can USE.
- If a clip doesn't make the viewer think "I need to save/share this" — don't include it.
- NEVER clip fragments, half-thoughts, or vague motivational fluff. That's spam, not content.

SEGMENT SELECTION CRITERIA (in priority order):
1. COMPLETE THOUGHTS: The clip MUST contain a self-contained idea with setup AND payoff. A clip that starts a thought but doesn't finish it is WORTHLESS. If the full thought takes 50 seconds, clip 50 seconds — don't cut it at 15.
2. ACTIONABLE VALUE: Tips, frameworks, specific how-tos, reframes, insights the audience can immediately apply. "Here's what to do" beats "here's what happened."
3. STRONG HOOK: The first 2-3 seconds must stop the scroll — but a great hook with no payoff is clickbait. The HOOK earns attention, the CONTENT earns the share.
4. STANDALONE CLARITY: Each clip is its own piece of content — a highlight reel from the full video reposted ALONE on social media. The viewer has ZERO context from the full video. They don't know the speaker, the topic, or what was said before. If a clip references a story, example, person, concept, or setup from earlier/later in the video without explaining it WITHIN the clip, it is NOT viable. The clip must establish its own context, deliver its own value, and reach its own conclusion. Ask: "If someone saw ONLY this clip and nothing else, would they get the full picture or feel like they walked in mid-conversation?" If the answer is mid-conversation, DO NOT INCLUDE IT.
5. MINI-PAYOFFS & REHOOKS: Longer clips need moments that re-engage every 8-12 seconds — a surprising stat, a pivot ("but here's the thing"), a specific example. Look for these to determine if a longer clip will hold attention.
6. EMOTIONAL RESONANCE: Evokes curiosity, urgency, surprise, or "I never thought of it that way."
7. SHAREABILITY: Content people would send to a friend, save for later, or comment "THIS" on.

WHAT TO EXCLUDE:
- Clips that reference something said earlier in the video without re-explaining it ("like I said before", "going back to that example", "remember when I mentioned")
- Clips where the speaker is mid-story or mid-argument and the viewer would feel lost without prior context
- Clips that only make sense as a follow-up to another clip — every clip must stand on its own
- Clips where pronouns or references are ambiguous without the surrounding video ("he told me", "that strategy", "this method" — WHO? WHAT method? If it's not clear within the clip, skip it)
- Rambling intros or throat-clearing ("so today I want to talk about...")
- Generic advice that doesn't teach anything specific
- Incomplete arguments — if the payoff comes 30 seconds after the setup, include BOTH
- Pure entertainment/humor with no value for the target audience
- Segments where the speaker is just repeating themselves

SCORING (0-100):
- 90-100: Must-clip — fully standalone + strong hook + specific actionable insight + high share potential. A stranger could watch this one clip and walk away with clear value.
- 80-89: Very strong — clear value delivery, complete idea, good hook, audience would save this. No missing context.
- 70-79: Solid — good standalone value, may benefit from tight editing but the thought is complete and self-contained.
- 69: Minimum — borderline; the thought is there but delivery could be stronger. Still fully understandable without any other context.
- Below 69: Do not include — incomplete thought, no clear value, requires outside context, or off-target for audience

DURATION & SCORING RELATIONSHIP:
- Clips under 25 seconds should RARELY score above 80. In 15-20 seconds you can deliver a punchy one-liner, but you almost never have time for setup + context + payoff + actionable value. If you're scoring a short clip 85+, ask yourself: "Is this TRULY a complete, high-value thought, or am I just rewarding tightness?" Most real value needs breathing room.
- The 30-50 second range is where the best clips live. A clip that hooks, builds context, delivers the insight, and lands the takeaway in 35-45 seconds should score HIGHER than a 17-second fragment at the same perceived quality. Prefer these clips.
- Clips 50-90 seconds are great IF every second earns its place — no dead air, no repetition, multiple mini-payoffs keeping the viewer engaged.
- Clips over 90 seconds are rare but valid when the speaker is on a genuine run of back-to-back value.
- If you find yourself about to create a 15-20 second clip, STOP and look at the surrounding transcript. Is there more context before or more payoff after that would make this a stronger 30-40 second clip? Almost always, the answer is yes. Extend first, then judge.

PAYOFF CHECK (do this for EVERY clip before finalizing end_time):
- Read the 15-20 seconds of transcript AFTER your proposed end_time. Does the speaker deliver a conclusion, punchline, key insight, actionable step, or emotional payoff in that window? If YES, you MUST extend end_time to include it. You are cutting before the value lands.
- Read the 5-10 seconds of transcript AFTER your proposed end_time. Does the speaker finish the current sentence? If NO, extend to at least the end of the sentence. Clips must NEVER end mid-sentence.
- Ask: "If I were a viewer, would I feel satisfied at this ending, or would I feel like the rug was pulled?" If the rug is pulled, extend.

TIMING RULES:
- ${getTimingRule(targetDuration)}
- MINIMUM 15 seconds — anything shorter cannot deliver a complete thought
- ~40 seconds is the TARGET for most clips — not a suggestion, a target. Actively aim for it.
- Clips CAN be 1-3 minutes IF every single second delivers value with no dead air or repetition. Long clips are rare but possible — do not artificially cut a great segment short.
- NEVER cut a clip short just to hit a time target. Complete the thought, THEN end.
- start_time MUST be LESS than end_time
- Segments must not overlap
- Use EXACT timestamps from the transcript
- Start at natural hook points, end AFTER the payoff/conclusion — not before it, not during it, AFTER it

HOOK TEXT:
For each segment, write 1-5 words of on-screen hook text that appears in the first 2 seconds. 80%+ viewers watch with sound off — the hook must work silently.

The hook must do ONE of these:
- CALL OUT the target audience: "Freelancers: stop doing this"
- NAME the specific problem or desire: "$47K/month from rentals?"
- OPEN a curiosity loop with a SPECIFIC detail: "The 3am rule changed everything"
- ATTACK a common belief: "College is a scam and here's why"

Rules:
- Use a SPECIFIC noun, number, or detail from the transcript — never generic filler
- NOT a summary of the clip
- No generic hooks like "Wait for it", "Watch this", "You need to see this"
- Must make the RIGHT audience stop scrolling — filter IN your people

SCORING (0-100):

- 80-89: Very strong — great hook, compelling content, broad appeal. No missing context.
- 70-79: Strong — good standalone clip, clear value or entertainment. Self-contained.
- 60-69: Decent — may need editing to shine, but still understandable on its own.
- Below 60: Weak — limited viral potential, or requires context from the full video to make sense.

CRITICAL: If the clip references people, stories, examples, or concepts that are NOT explained within the clip itself, score it LOWER. A clip where the viewer feels like they walked in mid-conversation is not viable content.
